**<p align="center">The destination is never final, I live for the journey.</p>**

Hi, everyone!👋 I'm Arlesha. I'm a ServiceNow Developer and a highly motivated and self-taught coder. I have a deep passion for pursuing and learning new things whether it's a new coding language or even a crafting project. Outside of my love for all things tech, I have a serious case of wanderlust 🗺️, a major chocolate addiction 🍫, and a love for scrapbooking, cooking, and cheering on St. Louis sports teams ⚾.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on a few ServiceNow projects for Hacktoberfest
- 🌱 I'm currently learning: SQL, Models, and Migrations; JavaScript; User Interfaces; Testing, CI/CD; Scalability and Security
-  ⚡ Fun fact: I love The Big Bang Theory sitcom ⚛️
